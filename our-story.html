      <h3>How We Met</h3>
      <p>
        What if we were to tell you that the reason this wedding is happening is because of Pete Carroll? Well stop wondering what if, because that IS why it’s happening, and we’ll explain to you why right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        In September of 2015, in a small town in the Berkshires of Massachusetts, both Dru and Ellen attended the wedding of their good friends Alden and Emily. It was a beautiful wedding, but we won’t get into that right now, because there was already a website devoted to their wedding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ellen and Dru smiled at one another during the reception. Dru coyly asked Ellen if they had met before... she looked so familiar. And then Ellen told Dru that, yes, they had met. Just a week ago. At their mutual friend’s play. “Oh yeah,” Dru said, realizing he had ruined everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        And they had met the week prior. Ellen remembers Dru was cute. Dru remembers Ellen was cute. But Dru also remembers thinking Ellen was on a date, so he ignored her like a total idiot, even though Ellen repeatedly tried to talk to Dru and thought he was very rude for ignoring her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, where were we... oh right... at the wedding where Dru had totally blown it. Right... that’s where we were.
      </p>
      <p>
        So anyway, Dru had messed everything up. But near a campfire they kept talking and found out they had a lot in common! They both majored in theatre, they both loved Shakespeare and they both lived in New York! But this was a wedding where that was true of virtually everybody.
      </p>
      <p>
        But then, later in the reception, they both wanted to get some air. Outside, away from the revelry, they ran into each other once again. Ellen admitted she went outside because her ESPN app didn’t get good reception on the dance floor, and she really wanted to check the score of the USC football game happening that night. That’s when our boy Pete Carroll came into the picture. The former USC coach was the current Seattle Seahawks coach, and the two bonded over their mutual love of the man who, honestly, looks very good for his age.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later that week they went on their first date, at a small bar in Brooklyn called Mission Dolores, and thankfully they had more to talk about than football.

      <h3>The Proposal</h3>
      <p>
        On January 21st of 2018 Dru popped the question. Weeks earlier, after consulting Ellen’s sister Grace, he had gotten her a beautiful ring (good call by Grace talking Dru out of the bright green one, which he was honestly considering), and had it all planned out as a surprise date...
      </p>
      <p>
        Their favorite restaurant was located just across the street from their apartment, a wood fired pizza place called Toby’s. Months earlier it had shut down, moving its business to a brand new expansive location on the Brooklyn waterfront, where neither Dru nor Ellen had ever been. He would surprise her... take her to the new locale, share one of their favorite pies, then casually drop the idea that they should grab a drink at Mission Dolores, the location of their first date. Outside of the bar Dru would ask her to marry him, then they’d walk into the bar where Alden and Emily, the reason they were together in the first place, would be inside waiting.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s how it was planned, at least.
      </p>
      <p>
        It started off without a hitch. It was a beautiful night as they began their walk to Toby’s. The entire time Ellen tried to guess where they were going... asking such questions as: “Have we been there before?” and Dru, feeling very clever, answering: “In a way.” It was all working according to plan. But then, after a 45 minute commute, they rounded the corner to find that Toby’s was CLOSED. Straight up closed. For no discernible reason. The website said it was open. Even the outside of the restaurant said that it was open. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OPEN. If only they had known that the owner of Toby’s owed over $30,000 in back taxes... and that they had unexpectedly, and unfortunately, decided to close the doors that very day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well this was a curve ball. Ellen kept suggesting other restaurants, and Dru was VERY mad that Toby’s was closed. Ellen didn’t understand why... there were other places to eat. They walked down the street and discovered a lovely little Italian restaurant and sat at the bar. Most of the conversation, we’re sorry to say, was about how upset Dru was that Toby’s was closed, and Ellen not understanding why it was such a big deal. But, honestly, the meal was better than Toby’s.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the check arrived, Dru confidently suggested they go grab a drink at Mission Dolores. Ellen said she wasn’t really in the mood for beer. Dru, not knowing what to do, loudly exclaimed that it was “a bar” and that it had more than “just beer.” At this point Dru was a bad date. But in his defense, Emily and Alden had just arrived at Mission Dolores, and because of the whole Toby’s debacle Dru and Ellen were running, like, 30 minutes late.
      </p>
      <p>
        So Ellen, realizing from Dru’s attitude that it wasn’t worth it, said, “Okay. We can go to Mission Dolores.”
      </p>
      <p>
        They began to walk. But what Dru had forgotten was that en route to Mission Dolores there was an ice cream place called Ample Hills... which is straight up the best ice cream. Ellen thought ice cream sounded great. Now, under normal circumstances Dru would jump at ice cream. But, also, under normal circumstances their friends weren’t secretly waiting for them while an engagement ring sat in Dru’s pocket. So Dru said, “We can get beer first, then we can get the ice cream,” which in all respects is a bad idea. NOBODY wants to get a beer and then eat a bunch of dairy.
      </p>
      <p>
        But when Ellen rightfully said: “No, we’re here now, let’s just get an ice cream,” Dru had no answer for it, so they got ice cream. And Dru frantically texted Alden and Emily, telling them they were running late. Alden, like a normal human, calmly responded with: “Don’t worry dude, take your time, we’ll be here!”
      </p>
      <p>
        So they ate their ice cream, and they began to walk. Outside of the bar Dru began telling Ellen about how nervous he was on their first date. They stood on the street corner, they shared a kiss, and then a car honked at them for PDA. At this point things get hazy for both Dru and Ellen. Dru insists he got down on one knee. Ellen insists Dru asked mid kneel. Either way he proposed, she said yes, and they walked into the bar where Alden and Emily were sitting, glasses of champagne at the ready. Which wasn’t Dru’s idea. Alden and Emily ordered the champagne unprompted. What a couple, huh?
      </p>
      <p>
        They toasted. What a night. We still can’t believe Toby’s was closed.
